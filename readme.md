Readme

This CI installation assumes that css, js and img files are stored
under the resources directory in their respective directories.

the root .htaccess file will sort out no index.php in the URL as
well as accessing the static css, js and img files

config/config.php need to change the base_url to your local url

config/autoload.php autoloads the url, form and html helpers

enjoy :)
